#Name of the project: DATABASE HANDLER

Description:
This project corresponds to the application of imagination and skills gained across the lessons of Level 2.

What is it about?
It is basically a Python file called database_handler.py which works along with files ebookstore.db and books_data.txt both allowed in the folder data

Installation:
This project makes use of the following external libraries:
 - TextTable (Installation details are at https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/texttable-module-in-python/)
 
As developers, we manage a workplace folder to keep our projects organized, with that matter, please copy the database_handler.py file and the data folder into your workplace folder. Finally, run the program and see how it works.

Utilities:
This can be useful if you need to have a dataset ready to be loaded and to be used for testing your functions.

Credits:
This project has been created by me as part of a HyperionDev Course lesson.
